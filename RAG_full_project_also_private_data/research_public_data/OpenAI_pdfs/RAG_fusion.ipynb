Usually, you should receive a decision\\nnotification about 4 weeks after the application deadline. If you have not received any answer yet\\nafter 4 weeks, please be patient. If you have not received any answer to your application after 8\\nweeks, we recommend you politely ask the Master’s Office about the current state of your\\napplication.\\nCan I apply for the study course programme with a degree from a technical\\nuniversity or university of applied sciences?\\nYes, any degree from a technical university or university of applied sciences will be treated equally\\nwith a degree from a university.\\nCan I apply for the study course programme with a degree from a dual study\\nprogramme?\\nYes, your degree from a dual study programme will be treated equally with a degree from a\\nuniversity if it consists of at least 180 ECTS being completed at a university .\\nWhy did I get a rejection for my application?\\nWe are sorry that your application did not lead to admission to this study course programme. In\\nmany cases the reason for rejection is that students have not the required qualification for this\\nstudy course programme, i.e., a completed B.Sc. degree in Mathematics, Industrial Mathematics,\\nMathematical Economy, Computer Science, Data Science, or Physics from FAU or another\\nequivalent domestic or international degree that is not significantly different with regard to the\\ncompetence profile taught in the respective degree.\\nIs it possible to defer my admission to an upcoming semester?\\nYes, it is possible to defer your admission.

You should discuss\\nchanges of your study plan agreement with your mentor.\\nCan I combine modules from different application subjects?\\nYes, you are free to choose the modules from any of the application subjects and combine them.\\nHow can I transfer ECTS for a module from one module group to another?\\nPlease send a polite email to the examination office and ask for the transfer of credits. This should\\nbest be done near the end of your studies to collect all changes necessary and hence minimize the\\nwork effort for the examination office.\\nCan I count modules from my major subject for the minor subject?\\nNo, modules for your minor subject must be chosen from specialisations other than your major\\nsubject.\\nCan I use my werkstudent experience to get ECTS as a technical qualification?\\nYou can use your working experience as a technical qualification if you work longer than 4 weeks\\nin a company and if your tasks are related to Data Science. The examination committee has to agree\\nto your work description in order to be usable as a module. Usually, you will have to hand in a short\\nreport (~ 10 pages) about your working tasks.\\n4'),\n",

You can find details on the current exam\\nregistration periods at https://www.fau.de/education/beratungs-und-servicestellen/\\npruefungsaemter/pruefungsamt-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/ .

Currently, the Campo system pre-selects on\\nof these module groups, making the other one inactive. If you cannot find the register button in the\\ncorrect module group and have not registered for the module yet, please proceed as follows:\\n1.Please log in to Campo and click Home  → My studies  → Study planner with module plan\\n2.Use the view options in the top to show all examinations, hide all lectures and expand all\\nmodules.\\n3.Use the your browser’s search function to search for your module. Make sure you find the\\nmodule name in the desired module group.\\n4.If you click on the title of the module in the desired module group as shown in the image below,\\nthe Register  button becomes available and you should be able to register.\\n5.If this does not work and the module is shown in gray than there is problem in the system,\\nwhich cannot be solved by you.

You should have completed all core modules and all modules of\\nyour major subject first. Afterwards you can start writing your Master’s thesis. The topic of your\\nMaster’s thesis should ideally fit the chosen specialisation and the topic Master’s seminar, following\\n§54 of the examination regulations (\"Mentoring\") and your individual study agreement.\\nHow can I find a topic for my Master’s thesis?\\nThe easiest way to find a topic for your Master’s thesis is to attend a Master’s seminar near the end\\nof your studies and work on a topic that you are interested in. In many cases your supervisor in the\\nMaster’s seminar can suggest you a topic for your Master’s thesis that directly builds upon the\\nsubject of your Master’s seminar. Since you have already invested time in literature research for\\nthis topic, this will save you a lot of work effort for your Master’s thesis.\\nAlternatively, you can also search for a Master’s thesis topic independently of your Master’s\\nseminar. For this you should contact the chairs at FAU that perform research in the area of Data\\nScience in which you are interested and politely ask for the possibility to write a Master’s thesis at\\nthis chair.\\nWho can be the supervisor of my Master’s thesis?\\nTo start your Master’s thesis you need an official supervisor from FAU first. There are certain\\nrequirements that have to be met by your supervisor. The person has to be a professor or at least\\nhave a finished habilitation (recognizable by the title \"Dr. habil.\" or \"PD\") and needs to have a\\nmembership in one of the following departments:\\n•Department of Data Science\\n•Department of Mathematics\\n•Department of Computer Science\\n•Department of Artificial Intelligence in Biomedical Enginnering (AIBE)\\nProfessors who are a secondary member in one of these listed departments can also supervise your\\nthesis. If you are not certain if they fulfil these requirement, please ask the person directly. Your\\nofficial supervisor is also the first examinator of your thesis and should propose you a second\\nexaminator for your thesis that has to fulfill the same requirements, but can be from any\\ndepartment at FAU. Your Master’s thesis can additionally be supervised or guided other FAU staff,\\ne.g., PhD students, who are working in the subject of your Master’s thesis. However, they cannot be\\nyour offical supervisors.\\nCan the supervisor of my Master’s thesis also be from an alternative department?\\nIn a few cases the examination committee might allow for exceptions if the proposed topic suits\\nyour study programme well and the proposed supervisor agrees to meet the requirements of the\\nexamination committee.\\n7'),\n",

Please\\nalso make sure that the second examinator of your Master’s thesis belongs to one of the four\\ndepartments mentioned above.\\nCan my Master’s thesis be completed in a company?\\nYes, it is possible to carry out the Master’s thesis in a company.
