Questions on the application and admission process have to be directed to the Master’s Office at zuv-masterbuero@fau.de\\n\\xa0\\nNews\\n\\nYou can now generate your study plan online at the new website of the Study Plan Generator (SPLAG).\\nWe have updated our frequently asked questions (FAQ) document, which can be downloaded here and at the bottom of this page.\\n\\nWhy apply for this program?\\nData Science has become a revolutionary technology that everyone seems to talk about. It is becoming a key concept for large private businesses, public institutions and research. While it is not easy to define it in a few words, data science deals with the methods and tools needed to analyze data and draw actionable conclusions from the results gained in the process. These methods and tools, which cover big data and their analysis, data modeling, machine learning, and simulation methods, are located mainly at the intersection of three subjects: computer sciences, mathematics, and statistics. Consequently, this new Master’s program at Friedrich-Alexander University is jointly taught by lecturers from these three fields.\\nThis program uses dynamic learning methodologies to ensure our students stand out in today’s competitive job market. Students will enjoy a wide variety of long-lasting benefits:\\n\\nHands-on teaching methodology.\\nA world-class institution.\\nIndividual, interest-based curriculum.\\n\\nCareer prospects\\nAs a data scientist you can work in national and international companies or in the public sector. Some exemplary sectors to find exciting job positions would be:\\n\\nTechnology Industry\\nThanks to the various developments in data science, this industry is gradually evolving from an art into a science. Modern cyber security mechanisms heavily rely on data science. Data scientists are bringing probabilistic and statistical methods into the IT industry. Data collected from different disciplines can be instrumental in helping with solutions to cyber security threats.\\nTravel Industry\\nTravel personalization has become an increasingly deeper process than it used to be. The possibility to create customer profiles based on segmentation, offering personalized experiences according to their needs and preferences, has its foundations in data science. Forecasting the behavior of travelers by knowing where they want to go next, what kind of prices are they ready to pay, and when to launch special promotions, hugely depends on the level of applying data scientists‘ skills and abilities.\\nEnergy Industry\\nThe energy industry experiences major fluctuations in prices and higher costs of projects. Obtaining high-quality information has not been so important! Data scientists help in cutting costs, reducing risks, optimizing investments and improving equipment maintenance.\\nPharmaceuticals\\nConnected to human health, the pharma industry has also emerged as an industry where data science is increasing its application. For example, a pharmaceutical company can utilize data science to ensure a more stable approach for planning clinical trials. Companies need to resort to data science in order to build precision into their calculations of the potential success or failure of the clinical trials.\\n\\nUndoubtedly, there are many more sectors that a data scientist can work. Data science careers are in high demand, particularly in Germany, and this trend will not be slowing down any time soon.\\nAfter the master’s degree, a scientific career is of course also possible. Definitely, you can then deepen your knowledge and develop various programming tools for scientific codes and data analysis.\\nAreas of specialization\\nAt the beginning of the master’s degree, one major field of study is selected from the following subject areas as part of an individual study agreement:\\n\\nData-based optimization\\nMathematical Theory / Fundamentals of Data Science (taught in German)\\nDatabases and Knowledge Representation (taught partly in German)\\nMachine learning / Artificial intelligence\\nSimulation and Numerics\\nMathematical Statistical Data Analysis (taught mainly in German)\\n\\nThe other subject areas together form the minor field of study. The courses are mainly taught in English. Every student chooses a mentor at the beginning of the study course. The mentor gives the student advice how to design the study plan in accordance with the student’s individual interests.\\nStructure of the degree programs\\nThe standard time to degree is four semesters (two years). Students must acquire 120 ECTS. The program is structured as follows:\\n\\nDetailed information regarding modules and study plan can be found under „Important document and further info“ paragraph in the „Module Handbook“ section.\\nPlease note that some of the core modules in the Master Data Science are only taught once per year, i.e., not every semester. This applies to both modules „Mathematics of Learning“ as well as „Selected Topics in Mathematics of Learning“, which are only taught annually in the winter semester.\\nApplication subjects\\nOut of the following application subjects, you should take modules with a total of 15 ECTS. You are free to choose modules mixed from all applications subjects in either English or German, depending on your language skills.\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence in Biomedical Imaging\\nChemistry (taught in German)\\nDigital Humanities (taught mainly in German)\\nGeography\\nGeosciences\\nInternational Information Systems\\nMaterial Science\\nMedical Data Science\\nMultimedia Engineering\\nPhysics (taught mainly in German)\\n\\nStudy course plans\\nIn the following we present three exemplary study course plans as an orientation help assuming you are studying Data Science as a full-time study (~30 ECTS per semester) and the first semester starts in the winter semester.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExample I (Major field: ML/AI)\\n\\nExample II (Major field: SN)\\n\\n\\n\\n1st semester\\n(winter semester)\\nApplication subject:\\xa0Wearable and Implantable Computing (5 ECTS)\\nApplication subject: Process Analytics (5 ECTS)\\nMajor field: Artificial Intelligence I (7,5 ECTS)\\nMajor field: Pattern Recognition (5 ECTS)\\nMinor field: Convex Geometry and Applications (5 ECTS)\\nCore module: Mathematics of Learning (5 ECTS)\\n(total: 32,5 ECTS)\\n\\nApplication subject: Business Intelligence (5 ECTS)\\nMajor field: Simulation and Modeling 1 (5 ECTS)\\n\\nMinor field: Middleware – Cloud Computing\\xa0 (7,5 ECTS)\\n\\nMinor field: Artificial Intelligence I\\xa0 (7,5 ECTS)\\nCore module: Mathematics of Learning (5 ECTS)\\n(total: 30 ECTS)\\n\\n\\n\\n2nd semester\\n(summer semester)\\nApplication subject: DH-Module 1: Language and text (5 ECTS)\\nMajor field: Artificial Intelligence II (7,5 ECTS)\\nMinor field: Partial Differential Equations Based Image Processing (5 ECTS)\\nMinor field: Distributed Databases and Transaction Systems (5 ECTS)\\nCore module: Deep Learning (5 ECTS)\\n(total: 27,5 ECTS)\\nApplication subject: Computational modelling of cancer network (5 ECTS)\\nMajor field: Simulation and Modeling 2 (5 ECTS)\\nMajor field:\\xa0Partial Differential Equations Based Image Processing (5 ECTS)\\nMajor field: PDEs in Data Science (5 ECTS)\\n\\nCore module: Deep Learning (5 ECTS)\\nTechnical qualification:\\xa0Approximate Computing (5 ECTS)\\n(total: 30 ECTS)\\n\\n\\n\\n3rd semester\\n(winter semester)\\nMajor field: Research Project AI (10 ECTS)\\nMinor field: Inverse Problems and their Regularization (5 ECTS)\\n\\nTechnical qualification: Nailing your Thesis (5 ECTS)\\n\\nCore module: Selected Topics in Mathematics of Learning (5 ECTS)\\nMaster’s seminar (5 ECTS)\\n(total: 30 ECTS) \\nApplication subject: Quantum Computing (5 ECTS)\\nMajor field: Numerics of Partial Differential Equations (10 ECTS)\\nMinor field: Discrete Optimization I (5 ECTS)\\nCore module: Selected Topics in Mathematics of Learning (5 ECTS)\\nMaster’s seminar (5 ECTS)\\n(total: 30 ECTS)\\n\\n\\n4th semester\\n(summer semester)\\nMaster’s thesis (30 ECTS)\\n(total: 30 ECTS)\\nMaster’s thesis (30 ECTS)\\n(total: 30 ECTS)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExample III (Major field: DO)\\n\\n\\n\\n1st semester\\n(winter semester)\\nApplication subject: Process Analytics (5 ECTS)\\nApplication subject: Digital Health (5 ECTS)\\nMajor field: Discrete Optimization I (5 ECTS)\\nMajor field: Convex Geometry and Applications or Algorithmic Game Theory or Optimization in Industry and Economy (5 ECTS)\\nMinor field: Pattern Recognition (5 ECTS) or Numerics of Partial Differential Equations (10 ECTS)\\nCore module: Mathematics of Learning (5 ECTS)\\n(total: 30 or 35 ECTS)\\n\\n\\n2nd semester\\n(summer semester)\\nApplication subject: DH-Module 2: Society and space (5 ECTS)\\nMajor field: Discrete Optimization II (10 ECTS) or Robust Optimization II (5 ECTS)\\nMinor field: Practical Course: Modelling, Simulation and Optimization (5 ECTS) or Software Applications with KI (10 ECTS)\\nCore module: Deep Learning (5 ECTS)\\n(total: 25 or 30 ECTS)\\n\\n\\n3rd semester\\n(winter semester)\\nMajor field: Advanced Nonlinear Optimization (10 ECTS) or Mathematical Foundations of Data Analytics, Neural Networks, and Artificial Intelligence (5 ECTS)\\nMinor field: Machine Learning for Time Series (5 ECTS)\\nTechnical qualification: Approximate Computing (5 ECTS)\\nCore module: Selected Topics in Mathematics of Learning (5 ECTS)\\nMaster’s seminar (5 ECTS)\\n(total: 25 or 30 ECTS)\\n\\n\\n4th semester\\n(summer semester)\\nMaster’s thesis (30 ECTS)\\n(total: 30 ECTS)\\n\\n\\n\\nPart-time study\\nSince the winter semester 2022/23 it is possible to study the M.Sc.

We defend our opinions on social media with heart and soul, rate the vacation photos of our fellow human beings, and consume digital content via the streaming service we trust. In the process, we leave a distinct digital footprint in the form of data. It is estimated that the entire human race currently generates a data volume of several zettabytes (that’s a one with 21 zeros!) per year. Not every bit and every click is relevant, but technological miracles can be performed based on the amount of our personal data collected, but they also raise questions:\\n\\nHow does Google know what I’m about to search for?\\nWhy do I always end up with more items in my Amazon shopping cart than I originally wanted to buy?\\nHow can Spotify gauge my musical tastes so well?\\nWhy does fake news often spread faster than the truth?\\nHow can Deep Learning teach a computer to beat the world champion in Go?\\nA few years ago, „Big Data“ was on everyone’s lips. The value of data was weighed up against that of gold, and the initial hype triggered a veritable gold-digging frenzy in the technology industry.\\n\\nNowadays, it is no longer about collecting as much data as possible, but rather about analyzing this data in a clever way and drawing the right conclusions from it. Big Data“ quickly became the term „Smart Data“. And this is precisely where the newly founded „Data Science“ degree program at FAU comes in:\\nIt represents a key discipline for the digital age at the interface between mathematics and computer science and other disciplines such as natural sciences, engineering, economics, and information sciences. The goal of this bachelor’s degree program is to provide a solid foundational and advanced education in both mathematics and computer science with a strong focus on the requirements of future Data Scientists. In addition, an application subject is taken in which one can put one’s acquired knowledge to the test, such as physics, business informatics, biology or medical technology.\\nDuring your studies you will learn:\\n\\nhow to categorize and abstract structured and unstructured data sources.\\nwhich mathematical methods can be used to model and analyze data.\\nhow predictions for the future can be calculated from data.\\nwhat the consequences are for decision making.\\nhow to store and manage large amounts of data efficiently.\\nhow data can be used for artificial intelligence training.\\n\\nThe standard period of study for the bachelor’s degree program is six semesters, with one semester in the second or third year of study specifically set aside for the possibility of a semester abroad, such as an ERASMUS semester at another European university.\\n\\n\\n\\nDisplay external contentAt this point content of an external provider (source: YouTube) is integrated.

At the same time you deal with logic, information visualization, and knowledge extraction from databases.\\n5th-6th semester: Consolidation and applicationIn the third year of study, you will listen to freely selectable in-depth lectures within mathematics and computer science, which specifically fit the course of study „Data Science“. Possible areas of specialization are Statistical Data Analysis, Data-Oriented Optimization, Mathematical Theory of Data Science, Knowledge Representation, Artificial Intelligence, as well as Simulation and Numerics. Here you can adapt your focus to your own interests, i.e. focus more on theory or practice. At the same time, you will apply the knowledge you have acquired in the first two years in lectures of your application subject.\\n6th semester: Bachelor thesisIn the sixth semester you will write your bachelor thesis in your chosen field of specialization.\\n\\nIn parallel to the above-mentioned study phases, you will continuously attend lectures from the core area of „Data Science“, such as mathematical data analysis and modeling, machine learning, or advanced design and programming. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t            Fields of study and specializations        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring the bachelor’s degree program, you will learn about important areas of mathematics and computer science, as well as core topics in the field of data science. You will train your analytical thinking skills and learn to abstract and structure complex relationships. For your later career, you will acquire the ability to cope with constantly changing problems.\\nThe training in Data Science takes place in equal parts in the areas of mathematics and computer science, whereby you can determine your own focus during the course of your studies.

It is becoming a key concept for large private businesses, public institutions and research. While it is not easy to define it in a few words, data science deals with the methods and tools needed to analyze data and draw actionable conclusions from the results gained in the process. These methods and tools, which cover big data and their analysis, data modeling, machine learning, and simulation methods, are located mainly at the intersection of the subjects mathematics and computer science. Consequently, this new Master’s program at Friedrich-Alexander Universität is taught jointly by lecturers from these fields.\\nThis program uses dynamic learning methodologies to ensure our students stand out in today’s competitive job market.
